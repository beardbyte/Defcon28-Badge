## Description
This year was crazy, so our origianl plan never happened. Howerever we wanted to do something so that people could have a badge for this year. Our idea was to have an open source design that you can buy parts online and put together at home. We did this with our first badge, and decided to revisit it now just in a smaller package ^_^

DCZia would like to present the PiBadge Mini: A Raspberry Pi Zero W with a Waveshare 1.44" LCD Display. We wrote a custom image for the Pi that will auto play some open source and in house made videos. 


## Hardware

The General Hardware used for this is:
Raspberry Pi Zero W
Waveshare 1.44" Pi Zero LCD Screen
SD Card

Optional unsupported but likely to work:
Any Pi
Any screen supported by https://github.com/juj/fbcp-ili9341
